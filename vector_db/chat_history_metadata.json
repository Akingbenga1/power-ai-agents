Overview\nPeterborough has a growing demand for social care services, due to demographic changes such as an aging population and increasing numbers of individuals with disabilities. Understanding this sector's current state involves assessing consumer needs, service provision, funding, and competitive landscape.\n\n#### 2. Market Size and Potential\n- **Aging Population**: Peterborough has seen a steady increase in residents aged 65 and over, which contributes significantly to the demand for social care services.\n- **Increased Disabilities**: National trends indicate growing numbers of individuals with disabilities, requiring diverse care solutions.\n- **Budget Allocations**: Local government expenditure on social care has been rising, although funding challenges remain.\n\n#### 3. Consumer Preferences\n- **Home-Based Care**: There is a strong preference for home-based care over institutional settings, influenced by quality of life considerations and cost factors.\n- **Integrated Services**: Consumers are increasingly interested in integrated care services that combine health and social care for a holistic approach.\n- **Personalization**: Demand for personalized care plans tailored to individual needs is growing, driven by consumer expectations and policy shifts.\n\n#### 4.
