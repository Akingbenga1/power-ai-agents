## Architecture

### Agent Flow with Complete History
1. **User Input** ‚Üí AI Workforce Manager (Triage Agent)
2. **History Retrieval** ‚Üí System retrieves complete chat history from ChromaDB (last 50 conversations)
3. **Decision Making** ‚Üí Analyzes request with full context and selects appropriate specialist
4. **Context Injection** ‚Üí Chosen specialist receives complete chat history from ChromaDB
5. **Task Processing** ‚Üí Specialist processes with full awareness of past conversations
6. **Response** ‚Üí Contextually aware response that builds upon previous work
7. **Storage** ‚Üí New conversation stored in ChromaDB with automatic embeddings

### Complete History Schema
Each agent receives:
```python
{
    "complete_chat_history": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:25",
            "user_prompt": "Original user request",
            "manager_response": "Complete manager response including agent output",
            "chosen_agent": "Agent Name"
        },
        # ... up to 50 recent conversations
    ]
}
```

## Dependencies

- **openai-agents**: OpenAI Agents SDK for agent orchestration
- **chromadb**: Vector database for semantic search and history storage
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **reportlab**: PDF generation capabilities
- **requests**: HTTP requests for web scraping

## Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Access
```python
from main import AIWorkforceManager

# Initialize with ChromaDB support
manager = AIWorkforceManager()

# Get complete chat history from ChromaDB
history = manager.history_manager.get_recent_history(limit=50)

# Format history for agent context
formatted_context = manager.format_historical_context(history, "Agent Name")

# Search for similar conversations
similar = manager.history_manager.search_similar_conversations("web scraping", n_results=5)
```

### Testing Complete History Integration

- Complete history formatting
- Agent context injection
- Continuity between conversations
- ChromaDB integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ChromaDB Installation Issues**
```bash
pip install chromadb==0.3.21
```

2. **OpenAI API Key Not Found**
- Ensure `.env` file exists with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`
- Check that the key starts with `sk-`

3. **ChromaDB Database Permissions**
- Ensure write permissions in the project directory
- ChromaDB will create `./chroma_db/` automatically

4. **Context Too Large**
- System automatically limits conversation length
- Adjust limits in `delegate_task` method if needed

5. **NumPy Compatibility Issues**
```bash
pip install "numpy<2"
```

6. **Pydantic Version Issues**
```bash
pip install pydantic==1.10.12
```

### Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG=true` in your `.env` file for verbose logging including:
- Complete history retrieval details
- Context injection information
- Agent decision reasoning
- ChromaDB operation details

**Note**: This system requires an active OpenAI API key and internet connection for full functionality. ChromaDB operates locally and does not require external services. Each agent receives complete conversation history for maximum context awareness and continuity. ChromaDB is a required dependency - the system will not function without it.
