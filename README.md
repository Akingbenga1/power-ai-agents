## Architecture

### Agent Flow with Complete History
1. **User Input** → AI Workforce Manager (Triage Agent)
2. **History Retrieval** → System retrieves complete chat history from ChromaDB (last 50 conversations)
3. **Decision Making** → Analyzes request with full context and selects appropriate specialist
4. **Context Injection** → Chosen specialist receives complete chat history from ChromaDB
5. **Task Processing** → Specialist processes with full awareness of past conversations
6. **Response** → Contextually aware response that builds upon previous work
7. **Storage** → New conversation stored in ChromaDB with automatic embeddings

### Complete History Schema
Each agent receives:
```python
{
    "complete_chat_history": [
        {
            "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:25",
            "user_prompt": "Original user request",
            "manager_response": "Complete manager response including agent output",
            "chosen_agent": "Agent Name"
        },
        # ... up to 50 recent conversations
    ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ChromaDB Installation Issues**
```bash
pip install chromadb==0.3.21
```

2. **OpenAI API Key Not Found**
- Ensure `.env` file exists with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`
- Check that the key starts with `sk-`

3. **ChromaDB Database Permissions**
- Ensure write permissions in the project directory
- ChromaDB will create `./chroma_db/` automatically

4. **Context Too Large**
- System automatically limits conversation length
- Adjust limits in `delegate_task` method if needed

5. **NumPy Compatibility Issues**
```bash
pip install "numpy<2"
```

6. **Pydantic Version Issues**
```bash
pip install pydantic==1.10.12
```

7. **Gradio Installation Issues**
```bash
pip install gradio>=4.0.0
```

8. **Web Interface Not Loading**
- Check that port 7860 is available
- Try different port: `demo.launch(server_port=7861)`
- Ensure firewall allows local connections

### Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG=true` in your `.env` file for verbose logging including:
- Complete history retrieval details

**Note**: This system requires an active OpenAI API key and internet connection for full functionality. ChromaDB operates locally and does not require external services. Each agent receives complete conversation history for maximum context awareness and continuity. ChromaDB is a required dependency - the system will not function without it. The Gradio web interface provides the most user-friendly experience with real-time chat, tabbed navigation, and integrated search capabilities.
